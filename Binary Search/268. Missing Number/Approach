Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation:
n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

SOLUTION

1. Sort the input array.
2. If the last number is not equal to the array length, then the missing number is n.
3. If the first number is not 0, then 0 is missing.
4. Otherwise, go through the sorted array from index 1 to end.
5. At each step, check if the current number is exactly 1 greater than the previous.
6. If not, the missing number is one more than the previous number.
7. Return the missing number once found, or -1 if all are in sequence.

TIME: O(n log n)
SPACE: O(log n)
