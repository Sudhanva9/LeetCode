A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers. Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

SOLUTION

TWO POINTERS - 

1. We only need the AlphaNumeric characters to be compared from both ends, ignoring special characters and spaces.
    - So, write a function to check if the character 'c' falls in the category.
2. While Left[c] is not an aphaNum, L++; while Right[c] is not an alphaNum, R--.
3. If the values from Left and Right are not equal, return False.
4. Else, return True.

TIME: O(n)
SPACE: O(1)
