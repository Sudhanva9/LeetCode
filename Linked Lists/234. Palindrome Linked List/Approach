Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
 
Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

SOLUTION

I) STACK - 

1. If the list is empty, it's considered a palindrome.
2. Traverse the entire list and push each node’s value into a stack.
3. Reset the pointer to the head of the list.
4. Traverse the list again, this time popping values from the stack.
5. Compare each node’s value with the popped value.
6. If any value doesn’t match, return false.
7. If all values match, return true — the list is a palindrome.

TIME: O(n)
SPACE: O(n)

-----------------------------

II) TWO POINTERS - 

1. Use slow and fast pointers to find the middle of the linked list.
2. Reverse the second half of the list starting from the node after the middle.
3. Set one pointer at the head and the other at the start of the reversed second half.
4. Compare values from both halves one by one.
5. If all values match, it's a palindrome; otherwise, it's not.

TIME: O(n)
SPACE: O(1)
