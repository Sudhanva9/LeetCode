Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]
Output: [4,6,7,5,2,9,8,3,1]

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 4:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

Constraints:
The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

SOLUTION

DFS RECURSIVE - 

1. Create an empty list to store the result.
2. Use a helper function (dfs) to recursively traverse the tree.
3. If the current node is null, return.
4. First, recursively traverse the left subtree.
5. Then, recursively traverse the right subtree.
6. After both children are processed, add the current node’s value to the result.
7. Return the result list after the traversal is complete.

TIME: O(n)
SPACE: O(n)
