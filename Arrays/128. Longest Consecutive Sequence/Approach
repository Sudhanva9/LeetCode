Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

SOLUTION

1. Create a HashSet and store all the values from 'nums' array.
2. Initialize the 'longest' sequence to 0.
3. Iterate throgh the elements of Set to check if the Set does not contain the element's left neighbor.
    - If there is no left neighbor of an element, then it is considered to be the start of a sequence, hence its length = 1.
4. If the same element has a right neighbor, that is, (num + length), increment the length by 1.
5. Return the max value of the (longest, length).


TIME: O(n)
SPACE: O(n)
