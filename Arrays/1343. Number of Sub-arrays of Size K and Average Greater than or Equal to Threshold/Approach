Given an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold, return the number of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to threshold.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).
Example 2:

Input: arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers.
 
Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 104
1 <= k <= arr.length
0 <= threshold <= 104

SOLUTION

SLIDING WINDOW - 

1. Since we need to return the number of sub-arrays of size k, we need to consider only 'k' elements in a window.
2. We need a counter, 'res', to count the number of sub-arrays that satisfy the condition and a variable 'curSum' to 
   add the sum of k elements.
3. Then, compute the sum of 'curSum' and the new kth element.
4. If the computed average of the k elements is greater than or equal to the 'threshold',
    - Increment the 'res' by 1.
5. Subtract the Left most element from the window as we are adding a new kth element in step 3 in order to move our window.
6. Return the 'res', the number of sub-arrays which satisfy the condition.

SPACE: O(1)
