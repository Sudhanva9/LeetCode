Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example 1:
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]

Example 3:
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]

Constraints:
1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

SOLUTION

1. Initialize a result array res of the same length as temperatures, filled with 0s.
2. Use a stack to keep track of pairs of temperature and their indices.
3. Loop through each temperature t in the array.
4. While the stack is not empty and the current temperature t is greater than the temperature at the top of the stack:
    Pop the top pair from the stack.
    Calculate the number of days waited (i - index) and store it in res at that index.
5. Push the current temperature and its index onto the stack.
6. After the loop, the res array will have the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature for each day.
7. If no warmer day exists in the future, the default value (0) remains.

SPACE: O(n)
