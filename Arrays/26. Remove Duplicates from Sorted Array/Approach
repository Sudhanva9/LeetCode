Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

SOLUTION

Example: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]

1. We will put the first unique value in the first position in the array and, the next unique value in the second position.
     And so, there is no need to disturb the value in the first position. This is also because the array is already sorted.
2. We can use 2 pointers, Left and Right. One pointer scans the array and the other (Left), tells how many unique values we've seen so far.
3. The Left pointer will give the number of unique values.

/-- PSEUDO CODE --/

function(nums[]) {

    l = 1;
    
    for (r = 1; r < nums.length; r++) {
        if (nums[r] != nums[r - 1] {
          nums[l] = nums[r];
          l += 1;
        }
    }

    return l, nums;
}
