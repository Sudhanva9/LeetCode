Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 
Constraints:
1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.

SOLUTION

1. Initial Check:
    If the input array strs is empty, return an empty string "" as there is no common prefix.

2. Set the Prefix:
    Set the initial prefix to be the first string in the array strs[0].

3. Iterate Through the Array:
    For each string strs[i] in the array (starting from the second string), check if the current prefix is a prefix of the string.
    If the prefix is not a prefix of strs[i], shorten the prefix by removing the last character and check again.
    Repeat this process until either a common prefix is found or the prefix becomes empty.

4. Return the Result:
    Once a valid common prefix is found, return the prefix.
    If no common prefix exists (i.e., the prefix becomes empty), return "".

TIME: O(S) -  where S is the sum of all characters in all strings.
SPACE: O(1)
