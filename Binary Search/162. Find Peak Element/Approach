A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

SOLUTION

1. Use Binary Search: Start with two pointers, l (left) at 0 and r (right) at the last index.
2. Find the middle element (m): Compute m as the midpoint of l and r.
3. Check if m is a peak:
      If nums[m] is smaller than nums[m - 1], move r to m - 1 (search left).
      If nums[m] is smaller than nums[m + 1], move l to m + 1 (search right).
      Otherwise, return m since it is a peak.
4. Repeat until a peak is found.

TIME: O(log n)
SPACE: O(n)
