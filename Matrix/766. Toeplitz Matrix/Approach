Given an m x n matrix, return true if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return false.
A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,1,2,3],[9,5,1,2]]
Output: true
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: false
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
 
Constraints:
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 20
0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 99

SOLUTION

1. A Toeplitz matrix has the same values along each diagonal from top-left to bottom-right.
2. Loop through every element in the matrix except the last row and column, because weâ€™ll compare each element to the one diagonally down-right.
3. For each element, check if it is equal to the element one row down and one column to the right (matrix[r][c] == matrix[r+1][c+1]).
4. If any diagonal pair doesn't match, return false.
5. If all diagonals are consistent, return true.
