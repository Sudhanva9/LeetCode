Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

Example 2:
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0

Constraints:
The Linked List is not empty.
Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
Each node's value is either 0 or 1.
_______________________________

SOLUTION

1. Start with the value of the head node as the initial number.
2. Traverse the linked list from left to right.
3. For each node, multiply the current number by 2 and add the node's value (binary to decimal logic).
4. Continue this process until the end of the list.
5. Return the final number as the decimal value of the binary linked list.

TIME: O(n)
SPACE: O(1)
