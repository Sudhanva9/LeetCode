Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

SOLUTION

HashTable - 

Base Case: If the length of the s and t are not equal: return false.

1. Create 2 HashTables for input string s and target string t: to track the counts of each character.
2. If the two counts are equal: return true, else false.

Time complexity: O(n+m)
Space complexity: O(1) since we have at most 26 different characters.
