Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.

SOLUTION

1. Start from the end of the string.
2. Skip all the trailing spaces by moving left.
3. Once a non-space character is found, start counting characters (this will be the last word).
4. Keep counting until you find a space or reach the beginning of the string.
5. Return the count â€” that's the length of the last word.

TIME: O(n)
SPACE: O(1)
