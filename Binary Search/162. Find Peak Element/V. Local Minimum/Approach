SOLUTION

1. We are using binary search to find a local minimum in an unsorted array.
2. We choose the mid index.
3. If mid is smaller than both neighbors (or the only neighbor, if it's an edge), it is a local minimum â†’ return it.
4. If the left neighbor is smaller, the local minimum must be on the left, so search left.
5. Otherwise, the local minimum is on the right, so search right.
6. We do this until we find and return a valid local minimum.
