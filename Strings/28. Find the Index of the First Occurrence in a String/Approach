Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 
Constraints:
1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

SOLUTION

1. Get the length of the needle and haystack strings.
2. Slide a window over haystack that is the same length as needle.
3. At each position, compare the substring of haystack with needle character by character.
4. If all characters match, return the starting index of the match.
5. If no match is found after scanning the whole string, return -1.
