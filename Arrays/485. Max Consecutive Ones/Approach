Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

SOLUTION

1. Use a single count variable to track the current sequence of consecutive 1s.
2. Use maxCount to store the longest sequence encountered so far.
3. Iterate through the array:
    If the current element is 1, increase count.
    If it is 0, update maxCount and reset count.
4. After the loop, return the maximum of maxCount and count.

TIME: O(n)
SPCE: O(1)
