Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

Example 1:

Input: s = "aba"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "abca"
Output: true
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.

SOLUTION

TWO POINTERS - 

a    a    a    z
L              R

Here L and R are not equal:
We can either skip Left or Right.

Incase we skip Left:
a    a    z
L         R
They are still not equal: Try other way
We skip Right:
a    a    a
L         R
They are equal: Return True. If even in this case would have not matched, we return false.

Write a helper function to check if a given string is a Valid Palindrome.
In the main function, if the L and R are equal, L++ and R--.
Else if the L and R are not equal:
  1) Pass the String by skipping Left element into our helper function to check if they are equal now and return the result. OR
  2) Pass the String by skipping Right element into our helper function to check if they are equal now and return the result.

TIME: O(n)
SPACE: O(1)
