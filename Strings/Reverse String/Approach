Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.

SOLUTION

TWO POINTERS - 

1. Start with two pointers: one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the array.
2. Keep swapping the characters at left and right.
3. After each swap, move left one step forward and right one step backward.
4. Stop when left crosses right â€“ this means the whole string has been reversed in place.

TIME: O(n)
SPACE: O(1)
