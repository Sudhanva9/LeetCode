Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
______________________________________________________

SOLUTION

ITERATION

1. Declare variables to point the previous node = 'prev', current node = 'current', and the next node = 'next'. 
    prev = null //Initially
2. While the current is not null:
    next = current.next : To not loose the next value's information, we are storing it in the 'next' variable.
    current.next = prev
Now shift the prev, curr, and next.
    prev = current
    current = next
3. Finally, when current becomes null, previous becomes the new head.
4. Return the prev value.
