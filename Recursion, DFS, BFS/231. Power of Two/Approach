Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16

Example 3:
Input: n = 3
Output: false

Constraints:
-231 <= n <= 231 - 1
__________________________________

SOLUTION

1. If the number is 0, return false (0 is not a power of two).
2. While the number is divisible by 2, keep dividing it by 2.
3. After the loop, check if the number has become 1.
4. If yes, it means it was a power of two; otherwise, it wasnâ€™t.

TIME: O(log n)
SPACE: O(1)
