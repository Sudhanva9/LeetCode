SOLUTION

1. Create a new array ans with double the length of the original array nums.
2. Loop twice through the nums array to copy its elements into ans one after the other.
3. Use a running index idx to place each element in the correct position in ans.
4. Return the ans array which now contains nums concatenated with itself.
